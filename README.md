### Project for course #3 - Getting and Cleaning Data





The aim for this project is to start from a messy bunch of text file data and perform a serie of operations through an R script to get a clean and usable dataset for the analysis.

All information about data source, transformations and result dataset are available on the codebook [here](https://github.com/francesco-g11/CleanData3/blob/master/CodeBook.md), while the script for data processing is [here](https://github.com/francesco-g11/CleanData3/blob/master/run_analysis.R)
